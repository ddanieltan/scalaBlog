There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have
inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got
a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:
```
if (isAwesome) {
  return true
}
```

```python
def function():
  ...

print(1)
```

```scala
object Person {
  def Walk(distance:String) = {
    distance.toInt
  }
}
```
